# Logical-Stack

**Logical-Stack** repository, one-stop-shop for all things DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) and problem-solving related! Because who needs a life, right?

## What's Inside?

1. **Algorithms**: Collection of algorithms that will make you question your existence. Binary search, quicksort, Dijkstra's, you name it! Get ready to have your brain turned into a pretzel.

2. **Data Structures**: Explore an array (pun intended) of data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, heaps, and more.

3. **Problem Solving**: A bunch of coding challenges and problem-solving exercises solved. Because, sleep is overrated.

Happy Debugging! ðŸš€ðŸ§
